A simple website which fetches
a) image from Google Maps
b) news articles from New York Times
c) Articles from Wikipedia

when user enters a street and city address in the search bar and hits submit.

The data is fetched through the AJAX requests made from the webpage to the respective APIs exposed by these websites.

This is just a POC on how these APIs work.
